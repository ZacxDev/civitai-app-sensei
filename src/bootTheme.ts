/**
 * The theme to PAINT WITH before `ready`.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `useBlockContext().theme` is a SENTINEL before `ready`, not a
 * signal: the SDK's pre-init snapshot hardcodes `theme: 'light'`
 * (@civitai/blocks-react `dist/internal/transport.js`, EMPTY_SNAPSHOT) and the hook
 * returns it unchanged, so its value is indistinguishable from a host that really is
 * light. Painting with it makes every viewer light until BLOCK_INIT lands — and
 * because index.html's boot skeleton is dark, that is dark → light → dark, a NEW
 * flash introduced at exactly the moment `bootSkeleton: true` stands the host's veil
 * down. Never branch on `theme` in a `!ready` path; use this instead.
 *
 * 🔴 IT READS BACK, IT DOES NOT RE-DERIVE. The inline script in index.html already
 * resolved this before first paint and recorded its answer on
 * `<html data-civitai-boot-theme>`. Reading that attribute is what guarantees the
 * React commit and the already-painted skeleton agree; re-running the same logic
 * here would only make them agree by coincidence. The OS fallback below covers the
 * paths where the attribute is genuinely absent (a test mounting <App> directly, or
 * index.html's `catch` where `setAttribute` threw).
 *
 * Unknown means DARK, here and in index.html and in `<meta name="color-scheme">`.
